# ECE Departmental Website
website for mahesh stores which is college student body to lend components, to showcase projects, research clubs, and our departmental magazine. I worked on the projects page. It is a prototype model, some edits need to be done.
Later we designed the backend database for it. Designed the complete ER diagram and created the tables in MYSQL. Integration part of it is left out, which is on process as of now.
